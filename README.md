Ionic push plugin Implementation

In this plugin i have implemented the ngcordova push plugin.
You can clone this project and goto ionic.io and create account and an app in that accout.
Replace the app name and keys with your app keys in js files.

Run the project in terminal by entering the following command. Make sure you are in project root folder. The command is

ionic serve.
